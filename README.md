# PIANO TEACHER

This is the website of a Piano Teacher offering tuition in piano.

A User will be able to see at a glance on the Home page, the Piano Teacher's credentials, that lessons can be provided either in-person, online, or a hybrid of both, and that Piano students of all ages and experience levels are welcome to take lessons.


## Features

### Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Lessons page and Get in Touch page, and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

### The Home page image

The landing page, or Home Page, includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to see that this is a website promoting and offering the professional service of an experience Piano teacher.
This section introduces the user to the Piano Teacher with an image of a piano keyboard.


### Piano Teacher's Biography

The Biography section allows the user see the biography of the Piano teacher overlaid on three further images, following UX 'Rule of 3'.


### The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for the Piano Teacher. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.  The footer also includes an external link to the Royal Irish Academy of Music from where they can purchase Grade music and register for Grade exams. The footer section will be common to the three pages of the website.


### Lessons

The Lessons page will provide the user with information about the lessons provided by the Piano Teacher and what they broadly cover.
This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify lessons provided for Adults and lessons provided for Children, where those lessons are taught - In Person or Online - the duration of those lessons and what they cover.  

### Get in Touch

This page will allow the user to Get in Touch with the Piano Teacher.  The user can also sign up for a piano lesson. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.  The user will be required to select a radio button to specify if they would like to take this lesson In Person or Online; indicate, by ticking a checkbox, whether they have previous experience taking piano lessons; and, use a radio button selection to specify whether the user is an Adult signing up for lessons for themselves, or whether the user is a Parent signing up for lessons for their child.  The user will submit their information via a 'Submit' button.

<!-- For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing

During coding and while ensuring the page was responsive, I had some issues with margin size interfering with element appearance on the page.  I used DevTools to source and fix the problem.

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

## Validator Testing

HTML
First pass through W3C validator returned an error in the meta element where the 'name' and 'content' attributes were incorrectly assigned. Fixed.

No errors were subsequently returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
<!-- Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. -->

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

<!-- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
